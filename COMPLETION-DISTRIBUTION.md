# Shell Completion Distribution via Homebrew

This document describes how shell completions are distributed through the Homebrew tap repository for `usbipd-mac`.

## Overview

Shell completions for `usbipd` are automatically installed when users install the package via Homebrew, providing enhanced CLI experience with tab completion for commands, options, and dynamic values across bash, zsh, and fish shells.

## Architecture

### Completion Generation
- Completion scripts are generated during Homebrew package installation using the installed `usbipd` binary
- The generation command: `usbipd completion generate --output completions`
- This creates three shell-specific completion files:
  - `usbipd` (bash completion)
  - `_usbipd` (zsh completion)  
  - `usbipd.fish` (fish completion)

### Installation Locations
Following Homebrew conventions, completions are installed to:
- **Bash**: `#{bash_completion}/usbipd`
- **Zsh**: `#{zsh_completion}/_usbipd`
- **Fish**: `#{fish_completion}/usbipd.fish`

These locations are managed by Homebrew and typically resolve to:
- Bash: `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/` or `/opt/homebrew/etc/bash_completion.d/`
- Zsh: `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/` or `/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/`
- Fish: `/usr/local/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/` or `/opt/homebrew/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/`

## Formula Implementation

### Install Method
The Homebrew formula includes completion installation in the `install` method:

```ruby
def install
  bin.install "usbipd-vX.X.X-macos" => "usbipd"
  
  # Generate and install shell completion scripts
  mkdir_p "completions"
  system bin/"usbipd", "completion", "generate", "--output", "completions"
  
  # Install shell completions to appropriate directories
  if File.exist?("completions/usbipd")
    bash_completion.install "completions/usbipd"
  end
  
  if File.exist?("completions/_usbipd")
    zsh_completion.install "completions/_usbipd"
  end
  
  if File.exist?("completions/usbipd.fish")
    fish_completion.install "completions/usbipd.fish"
  end
  
  # ... system extension installation continues
end
```

### Post-Install Message
Users are informed about completion availability:

```ruby
def post_install
  puts "Shell completions have been automatically installed and should be available"
  puts "in new shell sessions for enhanced CLI experience with tab completion."
  puts
  puts "Supported shells: bash, zsh, fish"
  puts "Type 'usbipd ' and press <TAB> to test completion functionality."
end
```

### Test Validation
The formula includes tests to verify completion installation:

```ruby  
def test
  # Test that shell completion files are installed
  assert_path_exists "#{bash_completion}/usbipd"
  assert_path_exists "#{zsh_completion}/_usbipd"
  assert_path_exists "#{fish_completion}/usbipd.fish"
  
  # Test that completion command works
  assert_match "Completion Generation Summary", shell_output("#{bin}/usbipd completion generate --output /tmp/test-completions 2>&1", 0)
end
```

## User Experience

### Installation Process
1. User runs: `brew install beriberikix/usbipd-mac/usbip`
2. Homebrew downloads and installs the binary
3. Homebrew generates completion scripts using the installed binary
4. Completion files are installed to appropriate shell directories
5. Post-install message informs user about completion availability

### Shell Integration
- **Bash**: Completions are loaded automatically if `bash-completion` is installed
- **Zsh**: Completions are loaded automatically with `autoload -U compinit; compinit`
- **Fish**: Completions are loaded automatically by Fish's completion system

### Testing Completions
Users can test completion functionality:
```bash
# Start a new shell session
usbipd <TAB>    # Shows available commands
usbipd list <TAB>    # Shows command-specific options  
usbipd --<TAB>    # Shows global options
```

## Maintenance Scripts

### Testing Formula Changes
Use the provided test script to validate completion installation:

```bash
./Scripts/test-completion-installation.sh
```

This script:
- Validates formula syntax
- Checks completion installation code
- Verifies test suite coverage
- Generates validation report

### Updating Formula with Completions
Use the completion-aware update script:

```bash
./Scripts/update-formula-with-completions.sh \
  --version v1.2.3 \
  --binary-url https://github.com/beriberikix/usbipd-mac/releases/download/v1.2.3/usbipd-v1.2.3-macos \
  --sha256 abc123...
```

This script:
- Preserves existing completion installation code
- Updates version and URLs
- Validates the updated formula
- Creates backup of original formula

### Dry Run Testing
Always test formula changes with dry run:

```bash
./Scripts/update-formula-with-completions.sh --dry-run --version v1.2.3 --binary-url https://example.com/test --sha256 abc123
```

## Troubleshooting

### Completions Not Working
1. **Check Installation**: Verify files exist in completion directories
   ```bash
   ls /opt/homebrew/etc/bash_completion.d/usbipd
   ls /opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/_usbipd
   ls /opt/homebrew/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/usbipd.fish
   ```

2. **Check Shell Configuration**:
   - Bash: Ensure `bash-completion` is installed and sourced
   - Zsh: Ensure completion system is initialized (`autoload -U compinit; compinit`)
   - Fish: Completions should work automatically

3. **Test Generation Manually**:
   ```bash
   usbipd completion generate --output /tmp/test-completions
   ls /tmp/test-completions
   ```

4. **Check Binary Functionality**:
   ```bash
   usbipd completion list  # Should show available commands
   ```

### Formula Update Issues
1. **Syntax Validation**: Run `ruby -c Formula/usbip.rb`
2. **Test Script**: Run `./Scripts/test-completion-installation.sh`
3. **Homebrew Audit**: Run `brew audit --strict Formula/usbip.rb`

## Future Improvements

### Pre-Generated Completions
Currently, completions are generated during installation. Future versions could:
- Include pre-generated completion scripts in release artifacts
- Eliminate the need for runtime generation
- Reduce installation time and dependencies

### Distribution Optimization  
- Bundle completion scripts with releases
- Update formula to install from artifacts rather than generate
- Maintain compatibility with current approach

## Integration with Main Repository

### Release Process
The completion distribution is integrated with the main repository's release process:
1. Main repository releases include the `usbipd completion` functionality
2. Homebrew formula is updated via repository dispatch
3. Completion installation happens automatically during Homebrew package installation

### CI/CD Integration
- Main repository CI tests include completion generation validation
- Formula updates are tested for completion functionality
- Repository dispatch events trigger formula updates with completion preservation

## Requirements Fulfillment

This implementation satisfies the following requirements:

- ✅ **Requirement 2.2**: Completions installed to `#{bash_completion}/usbipd`
- ✅ **Requirement 2.3**: Completions installed to `#{zsh_completion}/_usbipd`
- ✅ **Requirement 2.4**: Completions installed to `#{fish_completion}/usbipd.fish`
- ✅ **Requirement 2.5**: Completions available immediately in new shell sessions
- ✅ **Cross-shell compatibility**: Supports bash, zsh, and fish
- ✅ **Automatic installation**: No manual setup required
- ✅ **Release integration**: Updates automatically with new releases

The implementation provides seamless shell completion distribution through Homebrew while maintaining compatibility with the existing package installation process.
